# CNN_CatsVsDogs_Classifcation_Keras

CNN - Deep Learning 

With Convolutional Neural Network + Keras + Jupyter Notebook create a CNN model to classify images between Cats and Dogs.
Training Images = 19998 (cats = 9999 and Dogs = 9999)
Test Images = 4998(cats = 2499 and Dogs = 2499)

It must follow the below directory structure:

C:/Users/epatdeb/TensorFlow_Project_1/CNN_CatsDogs/Pets_cnn/training_set:
                                                                          Cat/
                                                                          Dog/
                                                                      

C:/Users/epatdeb/TensorFlow_Project_1/CNN_CatsDogs/Pets_cnn/test_set:
                                                                          Cat/
                                                                          Dog/
                                                                          
                                                                          
 Store all the images of Cats under 'Cat' and of dogs under 'Dog' directory.
 All training images should be placed under(Cat and Dog folder defined under) training_set and testing images should be placed under(Cat and Dog folder defined under) test_set directory.
